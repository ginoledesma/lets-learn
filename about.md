This site is a collection of my notes as I progress through learning foreign languages. I mostly rely on Pimsleur's language programs for conversational proficiency. I supplement it with Duolingo's online courses, and sometimes Rosetta Stone. When I get to a level of being able to follow converations at a moderate pace, I start listening to podcasts and watching TV programs.

Pimsleur
--------

I'm a huge fan of [Pimsleur's Language programs](https://www.pimsleur.com). I've been using it sporadically since the early 2000s, and I've found it fairly effective *for me*. I like being able to listen while commuting to work, during breaks, or doing chores around the house.

Pimsleur helped me get to a *conversational level*. Though not quite at the level of fluency and proficiency, it did help me overcome the fear of ridicule when trying to speak a foreign language with a native. Plus, getting pronunciation right was a big win.

I've mostly done the Spanish and Japanese courses and plan on picking up others over time.

One disadvantage to Pimsleur's spoken approach is that you get practically no help in reading or writing the new language. While this *may* be passable with Romance or Germanic languages using Latin-based script, it's of no use at all with Eastern languages that use logograms.

I've annotated each lesson in Pimsleur's programs. My intention is not to transcribe the contents of the audio program, but rather to identify the words, phrases, and topics covered in a given lesson. It's mainly so I can revisit specific topics in the future without having to randomly guess the lessons.

Duolingo
--------

[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) is a great way to learn a language for free (supported by ads). It covers reading, writing, and speaking presented in a gamified manner. This works for a lot of people, but I've found its repetitive manner somewhat tedious and not very *sticky*. There are also times when the difficulty level spikes abruptly from one lesson to the next. For example, when I was trying to learn Japanese, words went from just using Hiragana and Katakana to Kanji before even the beginner levels were cleared.
